## 🧐 Objective 
People who want to make a living as a comic/digital artist don't have a place to show off their work or earn money. Mint allows you to take a stand for yourself. This programme also aims to reintroduce comics to the mainstream by digitising them and merging them into the metaverse's future vision.

<br>


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ⚒️ About The Project

Mint is a blockchain-based comic app that allows content creators to create new comics based on their imaginations and sell them on the market for cryptocurrency. People who wish to make comics as a living can receive a platform to display their ability while also earning money for their efforts.


<br>
<br>

## 🙌🏻 Novelty of our project
- Mint allows users to employ neural style transfer to turn their photographs to comic style.
- Because the app was created with Flutter, it is compatible with both Android and iOS.
- The Ethereum Block-chain facilitates all transactions.
This application fits into the metaverse's long-term vision.
